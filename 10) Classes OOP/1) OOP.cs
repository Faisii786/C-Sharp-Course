TOPIC 18: OBJECT-ORIENTED PROGRAMMING (OOP) - Foundation
================================================================================

WHAT IS THIS?
-------------
OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) organizes code into objects that contain both
data (properties) and behavior (methods). It's the foundation of C# and modern
programming. Classes are blueprints, objects are instances.

WHY DO WE NEED THIS?
--------------------
- Code organization - Group related data and methods together
- Reusability - Create objects from classes, use multiple times
- Maintainability - Changes in one place affect all objects
- Real-world modeling - Code mirrors real-world concepts
- Industry standard - Used in all professional applications

WHERE IS THIS USED?
-------------------
- Every C# application - C# is object-oriented
- User management: User class with name, email, methods
- E-commerce: Product class, Order class, Customer class
- Games: Player class, Enemy class, Weapon class
- Business applications: Employee, Department, Invoice classes

CONCEPTS YOU'LL LEARN:
---------------------
1. Classes - Blueprints for objects
2. Objects - Instances of classes
3. Properties - Data stored in objects
4. Methods - Actions objects can perform
5. Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism (advanced topics)

// C# - What is OOP?
// OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming.

// Procedural programming is about writing procedures or methods that perform operations on the data, while object-oriented programming is about creating objects that contain both data and methods.

// Object-oriented programming has several advantages over procedural programming:

// OOP is faster and easier to execute
// OOP provides a clear structure for the programs
// OOP helps to keep the C# code DRY "Don't Repeat Yourself", and makes the code easier to maintain, modify and debug
// OOP makes it possible to create full reusable applications with less code and shorter development time
// Tip: The "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY) principle is about reducing the repetition of code. You should extract out the codes that are common for the application, and place them at a single place and reuse them instead of repeating it.

// C# - What are Classes and Objects?
// Classes and objects are the two main aspects of object-oriented programming.

// Look at the following illustration to see the difference between class and objects:

// class
// Fruit

// objects
// Apple

// Banana

// Mango

// Another example:

// class
// Car

// objects
// Volvo

// Audi

// Toyota

// So, a class is a template for objects, and an object is an instance of a class.

// When the individual objects are created, they inherit all the variables and methods from the class.

// You will learn much more about classes and objects in the next chapter.
