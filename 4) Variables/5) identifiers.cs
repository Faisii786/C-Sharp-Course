// ========== TOPIC 4: IDENTIFIERS — Refresh: names = letters/digits/_; start with letter or _; case-sensitive ==========
// C# Identifiers
// All C# variables must be identified with unique names.

// These unique names are called identifiers.

// Identifiers can be short names (like x and y) or more descriptive names (age, sum, totalVolume).

// Note: It is recommended to use descriptive names in order to create understandable and maintainable code:

// Example
// Good
int minutesPerHour = 60;

// OK, but not so easy to understand what m actually is
int m = 60;

// The general rules for naming variables are:

// Names can contain letters, digits and the underscore character (_)
// Names must begin with a letter or underscore
// Names should start with a lowercase letter, and cannot contain whitespace
// Names are case-sensitive ("myVar" and "myvar" are different variables)
// Reserved words (like C# keywords, such as int or double) cannot be used as name

/*
=== TOPIC 4 SUMMARY (VARIABLES): IDENTIFIERS ===
- Variable names can use letters, digits, underscore; must start with letter or _; case-sensitive; avoid C# keywords; prefer descriptive names (e.g. minutesPerHour).
- Remember: myVar and myvar are different. No spaces in names. Use camelCase for variables.
