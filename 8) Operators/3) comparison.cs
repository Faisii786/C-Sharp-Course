// ========== TOPIC 8: COMPARISON OPERATORS — Refresh: == != > < >= <= (return true/false) ==========
// Comparison Operators
// Comparison operators are used to compare two values (or variables). This is important in programming, because it helps us to find answers and make decisions.

// The return value of a comparison is either True or False. These values are known as Boolean values, and you will learn more about them in the Booleans and If..Else chapter.

// In the following example, we use the greater than operator (>) to find out if 5 is greater than 3:

// Example
int x = 5;
int y = 3;
Console.WriteLine(x > y); // returns True because 5 is greater than 3

// A list of all comparison operators:

// Operator	Name	Example	Try it
// ==	Equal to	x == y	
// !=	Not equal	x != y	
// >	Greater than	x > y	
// <	Less than	x < y	
// >=	Greater than or equal to	x >= y	
// <=	Less than or equal to	x <= y	

/*
=== TOPIC 8 SUMMARY (OPERATORS): COMPARISON ===
- Result is true/false: == equal, != not equal, >, <, >=, <=.
- Remember: == is "equal to" (two equals). = is assignment. Use these in if conditions and loops.
