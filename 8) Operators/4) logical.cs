// ========== TOPIC 8: LOGICAL OPERATORS — Refresh: && AND, || OR, ! NOT ==========
// Logical Operators
// As with comparison operators, you can also test for True or False values with logical operators.

// Logical operators are used to determine the logic between variables or values:

// Operator	Name	Description	Example	Try it
// && 	Logical and	Returns True if both statements are true	x < 5 &&  x < 10	
// || 	Logical or	Returns True if one of the statements is true	x < 5 || x < 4	
// !	Logical not	Reverse the result, returns False if the result is true	!(x < 5 && x < 10)	
// You will learn more about comparison and logical operators in the Booleans and If...Else chapters.

/*
=== TOPIC 8 SUMMARY (OPERATORS): LOGICAL ===
- && AND (both true), || OR (at least one true), ! NOT (flip true/false).
- Remember: && needs both; || needs one. !(x < 5) is true when x >= 5. Combine with comparison in if.
